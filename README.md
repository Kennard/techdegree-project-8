# SQL Library Manager

This demo application is a designed to managed a database of books for perhaps a local library to help them manage their 
collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually. 
The librarian wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, I've built a web application that'll include pages to list, add, update, delete and search books. 
This project results in a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
