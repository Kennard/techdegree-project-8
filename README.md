# SQL Library Manager

This sample application is designed to managed a database of items. For this example sites we are using books for a local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually. 
The librarian wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books. This project could just as well be used to store a collection of movies, music artist or recipes.

The results is a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, delete and search books in a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
